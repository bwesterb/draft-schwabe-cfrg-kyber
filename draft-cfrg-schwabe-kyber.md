# Introduction

Kyber is NIST's pick for a post-quantum key agreement {{NISTR3}}.

Kyber is not a Diffie-Hellman (DH) style non-interactive key agreement,
but instead, Kyber is a Key Encapsulation Method (KEM).
A KEM is a three-tuple of algorithms (*KeyGen*, *Encapsulate*, *Decapsulate*):

 - *KeyGen* takes no inputs and generates a private key and a public key;
 - *Encapsulate* takes as input a public key and produces as output
   a ciphertext and a shared secret;
 - *Decapsulate* takes as input a ciphertext and a private key and
   produces a shared secret.

Like DH, a KEM can be used as an unauthenticated key-agreement
protocol, for example in TLS {{HYBRID}} {{XYBERTLS}}.
However, unlike DH, a KEM-based key agreement is *interactive*,
because the party executing Encapsulate can compute its protocol
message (the ciphertext) only after having received the input
(public key) from the party running *KeyGen* and *Decapsulate*.

A KEM can be transformed into a PKE scheme using HPKE {{RFC9180}} {{XYBERHPKE}}.

## Warning on stability and relation to ML-KEM

**NOTE** This draft is not stable and does not (yet) match the final
NIST standard ML-KEM (FIPS 203) expected in 2024. It matches
the draft for ML-KEM published by NIST August 2023. {{MLKEM}}

# Overview

Kyber is an IND-CCA2 secure KEM. It is constructed by applying a
Fujisaki-Okamato style transformation on InnerPKE, which is
the underlying IND-CPA secure Public Key Encryption scheme.
We cannot use InnerPKE directly, as its ciphertexts are malleable.

                       F.O. transform
       InnerPKE   ---------------------->   Kyber
       IND-CPA                              IND-CCA2

Kyber is a lattice-based scheme. More precisely, its security
is based on the learning-with-errors-and-rounding problem in module
lattices (MLWER).
The underlying polynomial ring R (defined in {{S-ring}}) is chosen such that
multiplication is very fast using the number theoretic transform
(NTT, see {{S-NTT}}).

An InnerPKE private key is a vector *s* over R of length k which is
_small_ in a particular way. Here `k` is a security parameter akin to the
size of a prime modulus. For Kyber512, which targets AES-128's security level,
the value of k is 2, for Kyber768 (AES-192 security level) k is 3,
and for Kyber1024 (AES-256 security level) k is 4.

The public key consists of two values:

- _A_ a k-by-k matrix over R sampled uniformly at random _and_
- _t = A s + e_, where `e` is a suitably small masking vector.

Distinguishing between such A s + e and a uniformly sampled t is the
decision module learning-with-errors (MLWE) problem. If that is hard, then
it is also hard to recover the private key from the public key
as that would allow you to distinguish between those two.

To save space in the public key, A is recomputed deterministically from
a 256bit seed *rho*. Strictly speaking, A is not uniformly random anymore,
but it's computationally indistuinguishable from it.

A ciphertext for a message m under this public key is a pair (c\_1, c\_2)
computed roughly as follows:

    c_1 = Compress(A^T r + e_1, d_u)
    c_2 = Compress(t^T r + e_2 + Decompress(m, 1), d_v)

where

- e\_1, e\_2 and r are small blinds;
- Compress(-, d) removes some information, leaving d bits per coefficient
  and Decompress is an "approximate inverse" of Compress;
- d\_u, d\_v are scheme parameters; and
- superscript T denotes transposition, so _A^T_ is the transpose of A,
  see {{transpose}} and _t^T r_ is the dot product
  of t and r, see {{dot-prod}}.

Distinguishing such a ciphertext and uniformly sampled (c\_1, c\_2)
is an example of the full MLWER problem, see Section 4.4 of {{KYBERV302}}.

To decrypt the ciphertext, one computes

    m = Compress(Decompress(c_2, d_v) - s^T Decompress(c_1, d_u), 1).

It it not straight-forward to see that this formula is correct.
In fact, there is negligable but non-zero probability that a ciphertext
does not decrypt correctly given by the DFP column in {{params}}.
This failure probability can be computed by a careful automated
analysis of the probabilities involved, see `kyber_failure.py` of {{SECEST}}.

To define all these operations precisely, we first define the field
of coefficients for our polynomial ring; what it means to be small;
and how to compress. Then we define the polynomial ring R; its operations
and in particular the NTT. We continue with the different methods of
sampling and (de)serialization. Then, we first define InnerPKE
and finally Kyber proper.

# The field GF(q)

Kyber is defined over GF(q) = Z/qZ, the integers modulo q = 13\*2^8+1 = 3329.

## Size

To define the size of a field element, we need a signed modulo. For any odd m,
we write

    a smod m

for the unique integer b with -(m-1)/2 < b <= (m-1)/2 and b = a modulo m.

To avoid confusion, for the more familiar modulo we write umod; that is

    a umod m

is the unique integer b with 0 <= b < m and b = a modulo m.

Now we can define the norm of a field element:

    || a || = abs(a smod q)

Examples:

     3325 smod q = -4        ||  3325 || = 4
    -3320 smod q =  9        || -3320 || = 9

[^4]

[^4]: TODO (#23) Should we define smod and umod at all, since we don't
    use it.
{:bas}

## Compression

In several parts of the algorithm, we will need a method to compress
fied elements down into d bits. To do this, we use the following method.

For any positive integer d, integer x and integer 0 <= y < 2^d, we define

      Compress(x, d) = Round( (2^d / q) x ) umod 2^d
    Decompress(y, d) = Round( (q / 2^d) y )

where Round(x) rounds any fraction to the nearest integer going up with ties.

Note that in {{S-VectorOps}} we extend Compress and Decompress
to polynomials and vectors of polynomials.

These two operations have the following properties:

 * `0 <= Compress(x, d) < 2^d`
 * `0 <= Decompress(y, d) < q`
 * `Compress(Decompress(y, d), d) = y`
 * If `Decompress(Compress(x, d), d) = x'`, then `|| x' - x || <= Round(q/2^(d+1))`
 * If `x = x' modulo q`, then `Compress(x, d) = Compress(x', d)`

For implementation efficiency, these can be computed as follows.

      Compress(x, d) = Div( (x << d) + q/2), q ) & ((1 << d) - 1)
    Decompress(y, d) = (q*y + (1 << (d-1))) >> d

where Div(x, q) = Floor(x / q). [^1]
To prevent leaking the secret key,
    this must be computed in constant time {{KYBERSLASH}}.
On platforms where Div is not constant-time, the following
    equation is useful, which holds for those x
    that appear in the previous formula for 0 < d < 12.

    Div(x, q) = (20642679 * x) >> 36

[^1]: TODO Do we want to include the proof that this is correct?
    Do we need to define >> and <<?

# The ring Rq {#S-ring}

Kyber is defined over a polynomial ring Rq = GF(q)[x]/(x^n+1)
where n=256 (and q=3329). Elements of Rq are tuples of 256 integers modulo q.
We will call them polynomials or elements interchangeably.

A tuple a = (a\_0, ..., a\_255) represents the polynomial

    a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_255 x^255.

With polynomial coefficients, vector and matrix indices, we will start
counting at zero.

## Operations

### Size of polynomials

For a polynomial a = (a\_0, ..., a\_255) in R, we write:

    || a || = max_i || a_i ||

Thus a polynomial is considered large if one of its components is large.

### Addition and subtraction

Addition and subtraction of elements is componentwise. Thus

    (a_0, ..., a_255) + (b_0, ..., b_255) = (a_0 + b_0, ..., a_255 + b_255),

and

    (a_0, ..., a_255) - (b_0, ..., b_255) = (a_0 - b_0, ..., a_255 - b_255),

where addition/subtractoin in each component is computed modulo q.

### Multiplication

Multiplication is that of polynomials (convolution) with the additional rule
that x^256=-1. To wit

    (a_0, ..., a_255) \* (b_0, ..., b_255)
        = (a_0 * b_0 - a_255 * b_1 - ... - a_1 * b_255,
           a_0 * b_1 + a_1 * b_0 - a_255 * b_2 - ... - a_2 * b_255,

                ...

           a_0 * b_255 + ... + a_255 * b_0)

We will not use this schoolbook multiplication to compute the product.
Instead we will use the more efficient, number theoretic transform (NTT),
see {{S-NTT}}.

#### Background on the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) {#S-NTT}

The modulus q was chosen such that 256 divides into q-1. This means that
there are zeta with

    zeta^128 = -1  modulo  q

With such a zeta, we can almost completely split the polynomial x^256+1
used to define R over GF(q):

    x^256 + 1 = x^256 - zeta^128
              = (x^128 - zeta^64)(x^128 + zeta^64)
              = (x^128 - zeta^64)(x^128 - zeta^192)
              = (x^64 - zeta^32)(x^64 + zeta^32)
                    (x^64 - zeta^96)(x^64 + zeta^96)

                ...

              = (x^2 - zeta)(x^2 + zeta)(x^2 - zeta^65)(x^2 + zeta^65)
                        ... (x^2 - zeta^127)(x^2 + zeta^127)

Note that the powers of zeta that appear in the second, fourth, ...,
and final lines are in binary:

    0100000 1100000
    0010000 1010000 0110000 1110000
    0001000 1001000 0101000 1101000 0011000 1011000 0111000 1111000
                ...
    0000001 1000001 0100001 1100001 0010001 1010001 0110001 ... 1111111

That is: brv(2), brv(3), brv(4), ..., where brv(x) denotes the 7-bit
bitreversal of x. The final line is brv(64), brv(65), ..., brv(127).

These polynomials x^2 +- zeta^i are irreducible and coprime, hence by
the Chinese Remainder Theorem for commutative rings, we know

    R = GF(q)[x]/(x^256+1) -> GF(q)[x]/(x^2-zeta) x ... x GF(q)[x]/(x^2+zeta^127)

given by a |-> ( a mod x^2 - zeta, ..., a mod x^2 + zeta^127 ) is an isomorphism.
This is the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). Multiplication on the right is
much easier: it's almost componentwise, see {{S-NTT-mul}}.

A propos, the the constant factors that appear in the moduli in order
can be computed efficiently as follows (all modulo q):

    -zeta     = -zeta^brv(64)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(0)}
     zeta     =  zeta^brv(64)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(1)}
    -zeta^65  = -zeta^brv(65)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(2)}
     zeta^65  =  zeta^brv(65)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(3)}
    -zeta^33  = -zeta^brv(66)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(4)}
     zeta^33  =  zeta^brv(66)  = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(5)}

                 ...

    -zeta^127 = -zeta^brv(127) = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(126)}
     zeta^127 =  zeta^brv(127) = -zeta^{1 + 2 brv(127)}

To compute a multiplication in R efficiently, one can first use the
NTT, to go to the right "into the NTT domain"; compute the multiplication
there and move back with the inverse NTT.

The NTT can be computed efficiently by performing each binary split
of the polynomial separately as follows:

    a |-> ( a mod x^128 - zeta^64, a mod x^128 + zeta^64 ),
      |-> ( a mod  x^64 - zeta^32, a mod  x^64 + zeta^32,
            a mod  x^64 - zeta^96, a mod  x^64 + zeta^96 ),

        et cetera

If we concatenate the resulting coefficients, expanding the definitions,
for the first step we get:

    a |-> (   a_0 + zeta^64 a_128,   a_1 + zeta^64 a_129,
             ...
            a_126 + zeta^64 a_254, a_127 + zeta^64 a_255,
              a_0 - zeta^64 a_128,   a_1 - zeta^64 a_129,
             ...
            a_126 - zeta^64 a_254, a_127 - zeta^64 a_255)

We can see this as 128 applications of the linear map CT\_64, where

    CT_i: (a, b) |-> (a + zeta^i b, a - zeta^i b)   modulo q

for the appropriate i in the following order, pictured in the case of n=16:

    -x----------------x--------x---
    -|-x--------------|-x------|-x-
    -|-|-x------------|-|-x----x-|-
    -|-|-|-x----------|-|-|-x----x-
    -|-|-|-|-x--------x-|-|-|--x---
    -|-|-|-|-|-x--------x-|-|--|-x-
    -|-|-|-|-|-|-x--------x-|--x-|-
    -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-x--------x----x-
    -x-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--x--------x---
    ---x-|-|-|-|-|-|--|-x------|-x-
    -----x-|-|-|-|-|--|-|-x----x-|-
    -------x-|-|-|-|--|-|-|-x----x-
    ---------x-|-|-|--x-|-|-|--x---
    -----------x-|-|----x-|-|--|-x-
    -------------x-|------x-|--x-|-
    ---------------x--------x----x-

For n=16 there are 3 levels with 1, 2 and 4 row groups respectively.
For the full n=256, there are 7 levels with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64
row groups respectively. The appropriate power of zeta in the first
level is brv(1)=64. The second level has brv(2) and brv(3) as powers
of zeta for the top and bottom row group respectively, and so on.

The CT\_i is known as a Cooley-Tukey butterfly. Its inverse is given
by the Gentleman-Sande butterfly:

    GS_i: (a, b) |-> ( (a+b)/2, zeta^-i (a-b)/2 )    modulo q

The inverse NTT can be computed by replacing CS\_i by GS\_i and flipping
the diagram horizontally. [^2]

[^2]: TODO (#8) This section gives background not necessary for the implementation.
    Should we keep it?
{:bas}

##### Optimization notes
The modular divisions by two in the InvNTT can be collected into a
single modular division by 128.

zeta^-i can be computed as -zeta^(128-i), which allows one to use the same
precomputed table of powers of zeta for both the NTT and InvNTT.

#### NTT and InvNTT

As primitive 256th root of unity we use zeta=17.

As before, brv(i) denotes the 7-bit bitreversal of i, so brv(1)=64
and brv(91)=109.

The NTT is a linear bijection R -> R given by the matrix:

                 [ zeta^{ (2 brv(i>>1) + 1) (j>>1) }               if i=j mod 2
    (NTT)_{ij} = [
                 [ 0                                               otherwise

Recall that we start counting rows and columns at zero.  The NTT can be
computed more efficiently as described in section {{S-NTT}}.

The inverse of the NTT is called InvNTT. It is given by the matrix:

                        [ zeta^{ 256 - (2 brv(j>>1) + 1) (i>>1) }  if i=j mod 2
    128 (InvNTT)_{ij} = [
                        [ 0                                        otherwise

Examples:

    NTT(1, 1, 0, ..., 0)   = (1, 1, ..., 1, 1)
    NTT(0, 1, 2, ..., 255) = (2429, 2845, 425, 1865, ..., 2502, 2134, 2717, 2303)

#### Multiplication in NTT domain {#S-NTT-mul}

For elements a, b in R, we write a o b for multiplication in the NTT domain.
That is: a * b = InvNTT(NTT(a) o NTT(b)). Concretely:

                [ a_i b_i + zeta^{2 brv(i >> 1) + 1} a_{i+1} b_{i+1}   if i even
    (a o b)_i = [
                [ a_{i-1} b_i + a_i b_{i-1}                            otherwise

# Symmetric cryptographic primitives

Kyber makes use of various symmetric primitives XOF, PRF1, PRF2, H,
and G, where

    XOF(seed) = SHAKE-128(seed)
    PRF1(seed, counter) = SHAKE-256(seed || counter)
    PRF2(seed, msg) = SHAKE-256(seed || msg)[:32]
    H(msg) = SHA3-256(msg)
    G(msg) = (SHA3-512(msg)[:32], SHA3-512(msg)[32:])

Here `counter` is an octet; `seed` is 32 octets; `prekey` is 64 octets;
and the length of `msg` varies.

On the surface, they look different, but they are all based on
the same flexible Keccak XOF that uses the f1600 permutation,
see {{FIPS202}}:

    XOF(seed)       =  Keccak[256](seed || 1111, .)
    PRF1(seed, ctr) =  Keccak[512](seed || ctr || 1111, .)
    PRF2(seed, msg) =  Keccak[512](seed || msg || 1111, 256)
    H(msg)          =  Keccak[512](msg || 01, 256)
    G(msg)          = (Keccak[1024](msg || 01, 512)[:32],
                       Keccak[1024](msg || 01, 512)[32:])

    Keccak[c] = Sponge[Keccak-f[1600], pad10*1, 1600-c]

The reason five different primitives are used is to ensure domain
separation, which is crucial for security, cf. {{H2CURVE}} §2.2.5.
Additionally, a smaller sponge capacity is used for performance
where permissable by the security requirements.

# Sampling of polynomials

## Uniformly
The polynomials in the matrix A are sampled uniformly and deterministically
from an octet stream (XOF) using rejection sampling as follows.

Three octets b\_0, b\_1, b\_2 are read from the stream at a time. These are
interpreted as two 12-bit unsigned integers d\_1, d\_2 via

    d_1 + d_2 2^12 = b_0 + b_1 2^8 + b_2 2^16

This creates a stream of 12-bit `d`s. Of these, the elements >= q are
ignored. From the resultant stream, the coefficients of the polynomial
are taken in order. In Python:

    def sampleUniform(stream):
        cs = []
        while True:
            b = stream.read(3)
            d1 = b[0] + 256*(b[1] % 16)
            d2 = (b[1] >> 4) + 16*b[2]
            for d in [d1, d2]:
                if d >= q: continue
                cs.append(d)
                if len(cs) == n: return Poly(cs)

Example:

    sampleUniform(SHAKE-128('')) = (3199, 697, 2212, 2302, ..., 255, 846, 1)

### sampleMatrix
Now, the *k* by *k* matrix *A* over *R* is derived deterministically
from a 32-octet seed *rho* using sampleUniform as follows.

    sampleMatrix(rho)_{ij} = sampleUniform(XOF(rho || octet(j) || octet(i))

That is, to derive the polynomial at the *i*th row and *j*th column,
sampleUniform is called with the 34-octet seed created by first appending
the octet *j* and then the octet *i* to *rho*. Recall that we start counting
rows and columns from zero.

As the NTT is a bijection, it does not matter whether we interpret
the polynomials of the sampled matrix in the NTT domain or not.
For efficiency, we do interpret the sampled matrix in the NTT domain.

## From a binomial distribution
Noise is sampled from a centered binomial distribution Binomial(2eta, 1/2) - eta
deterministically  as follows.

An octet array a of length 64\*eta is converted to a polynomial CBD(a, eta)

    CBD(a, eta)_i = b_{2i eta} + b_{2i eta + 1} + ... + b_{2i eta + eta-1}
                  - b_{2i eta + eta} - ... - b_{2i eta + 2eta - 1},

where b = OctetsToBits(a).

Examples:

    CBD((0, 1, 2, ..., 127), 2) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ..., 3328, 1, 0, 1)
    CBD((0, 1, 2, ..., 191), 3) = (0, 1, 3328, 0, 2, ..., 3328, 3327, 3328, 1)

### sampleNoise
A *k* component small vector *v* is derived from a seed 32-octet seed *sigma*,
an offset *offset* and size *eta* as follows:

    sampleNoise(sigma, eta, offset)_i = CBD(PRF1(sigma, octet(i+offset)), eta)

Recall that we start counting vector indices at zero.


# Vector and matrices

## Operations on vectors {#S-VectorOps}

Recall that Compress(x, d) maps a field element x into {0, ..., 2^d-1}.
In Kyber d is at most 11 and so we can interpret Compress(x, d) as a field
element again.

In this way, we can extend Compress(-, d) to polynomials by applying
to each coefficient separately and in turn to vectors by applying
to each polynomial. That is, for a vector v and polynomial p:

    Compress(p, d)_i = Compress(p_i, d)
    Compress(v, d)_i = Compress(v_i, d)

## Dot product and matrix multiplication {#dot-prod}

We will also use "o", from section {{S-NTT-mul}},
to denote the dot product and matrix multiplication
in the NTT domain. Concretely:

1. For two length k vector v and w, we write

        v o w = v_0 o w_0 + ... + v_{k-1} o w_{k-1}

2. For a k by k matrix A and a length k vector v, we have

        (A o v)_i = A_i o v,

   where A\_i denotes the (i+1)th row of the matrix A as we start
   counting at zero.

## Transpose {#transpose}

For a matrix A, we denote by A^T the tranposed matrix. To wit:

    A^T_ij = A_ji.

We define Decompress(-, d) for vectors and polynomials in the same way.


# Serialization

## OctetsToBits
For any list of octets a\_0, ..., a\_{s-1}, we define OctetsToBits(a), which
is a list of bits of length 8s, defined by

    OctetsToBits(a)_i = ((a_(i>>3)) >> (i umod 8)) umod 2.

Example:

    OctetsToBits(12,45) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0)

## Encode and Decode
For an integer 0 < w <= 12, we define Decode(a, w), which converts
any  list a of w\*l/8 octets into a list of length l with
values in {0, ..., 2^w-1} as follows.

    Decode(a, w)_i = b_{wi} + b_{wi+1} 2 + b_{wi+2} 2^2 + ... + b_{wi+w-1} 2^{w-1},

where b = OctetsToBits(a).

Encode(-, w) is the unique inverse of Decode(-, w)

### Polynomials
A polynomial p is encoded by passing its coefficients to Encode:

    EncodePoly(p, w) = Encode(p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}, w)

DecodePoly(-, w) is the unique inverse of EncodePoly(-, w).

### Vectors
A vector v of length k over R is encoded by concatenating the coefficients
in the obvious way:

    EncodeVec(v, w) = Encode((v_0)_0, ..., (v_0)_{n-1},
                             (v_1)_{0}, ..., (v_1)_{n-1},
                                    ..., (v_{k-1})_{n-1}, w)

DecodeVec(-, w) is the unique inverse of EncodeVec(-, w).


# Inner malleable public-key encryption scheme

We are ready to define the IND-CPA secure Public-Key Encryption scheme that
underlies Kyber. It is unsafe to use this underlying scheme directly as
its ciphertexts are malleable. Instead, a Public-Key Encryption scheme
can be constructed on top of Kyber by using HPKE {{RFC9180}} {{XYBERHPKE}}.

## Parameters
We have already been introduced to the following parameters:

*q*
: Order of field underlying *R*.

*n*
: Length of polynomials in *R*.

*zeta*
: Primitive root of unity in GF(q), used for NTT in R.

*XOF*, *H*, *G*, *PRF1*, *PRF2*
: Various symmetric primitives.

*k*
: Main security parameter: the number of rows and columns in the matrix *A*.

Additionally, Kyber takes the following parameters

*eta1*, *eta2*
: Size of small coefficients used in the private key and noise vectors.

*d\_u*, *d\_v*
: How many bits to retain per coefficient of the *u* and *v* components
of the ciphertext.

The values of these parameters are given in {{S-params}}.

## Key generation
InnerKeyGen(seed) takes a 32 octet **seed** and deterministically
produces a keypair as follows.

1. Set (rho, sigma) = G(seed).
2. Derive
    1. AHat = sampleMatrix(rho).
    2. s = sampleNoise(sigma, eta1, 0)
    3. e = sampleNoise(sigma, eta1, k)
3. Compute
    1. sHat = NTT(s)
    2. tHat = AHat o sHat + NTT(e)
4. Return
    1. publicKey = EncodeVec(tHat, 12) \|\| rho
    2. privateKey = EncodeVec(sHat, 12)

Note that in essence we're simply computing t = A s + e.

## Encryption
InnerEnc(msg, publicKey, seed) takes a 32-octet seed,
and deterministically encrypts the 32-octet msg for the InnerPKE public
key publicKey as follows.

1. Split publicKey into
    1. k\*(n/8)\*12-octet tHatPacked
    2. 32-octet rho
2. Parse tHat = DecodeVec(tHatPacked, 12)
3. Derive
    1. AHat = sampleMatrix(rho)
    2. r = sampleNoise(seed, eta1, 0)
    3. e\_1 = sampleNoise(seed, eta2, k)
    4. e\_2 = sampleNoise(seed, eta2, 2k)\_0
4. Compute
    1. rHat = NTT(r)
    2. u = InvNTT(AHat^T o rHat) + e\_1
    3. v = InvNTT(tHat o rHat) + e\_2 + Decompress(DecodePoly(msg, 1), 1)
    4. c\_1 = EncodeVec(Compress(u, d\_u), d\_u)
    5. c\_2 = EncodePoly(Compress(v, d\_v), d\_v)
5. Return
    1. cipherText = c\_1 \|\| c\_2

## Decryption
InnerDec(cipherText, privateKey) takes an InnerPKE private key
privateKey and decrypts a cipher text cipherText as follows.

1. Split cipherText into
    1. d\_u\*k\*n/8-octet c\_1
    2. d\_v\*n/8-octet c\_2
2. Parse
    1. u = Decompress(DecodeVec(c\_1, d\_u), d\_u)
    2. v = Decompress(DecodePoly(c\_2, d\_v), d\_v)
    3. sHat = DecodeVec(privateKey, 12)
3. Compute
    1. m = v - InvNTT(sHat o NTT(u))
4. Return
    1. plainText = EncodePoly(Compress(m, 1), 1)


# Kyber

Now we are ready to define Kyber itself.

## Key generation

A Kyber keypair is derived deterministically from a 64-octet seed as follows.

1. Split seed into
    2. A 32-octet cpaSeed
    1. A 32-octet z
2. Compute
    1. (cpaPublicKey, cpaPrivateKey) = InnerKeyGen(cpaSeed)
    2. h = H(cpaPublicKey)
3. Return
    1. publicKey = cpaPublicKey
    2. privateKey = cpaPrivateKey \|\| cpaPublicKey \|\| h \|\| z

## Encapsulation

Kyber encapsulation takes a public key and generates a shared secret
and ciphertext for the public key as follows.

1. Sample secret cryptographically-secure random 32-octet seed.
2. Compute
    1. (K, cpaSeed) = G(seed \|\| H(publicKey))
    2. cpaCipherText = InnerEnc(seed, publicKey, cpaSeed)
3. Return
    1. cipherText = cpaCipherText
    2. sharedSecret = K

## Decapsulation {#S-decaps}
Kyber decapsulation takes a private key and a cipher text and
returns a shared secret as follows.

1. Split privateKey into
    1. A 12\*k\*n/8-octet cpaPrivateKey
    2. A 12\*k\*n/8+32-octet cpaPublicKey
    3. A 32-octet h
    4. A 32-octet z
2. Compute
    1. m2 = InnerDec(cipherText, cpaPrivateKey)
    2. (ss1, cpaSeed2) = G(m2 \|\| h)
    3. cipherText2 = InnerEnc(m2, cpaPublicKey, cpaSeed2)
    5. ss2 = PRF2(z, cipherText)
3. In constant-time, set ss = ss1 if cipherText == cipherText2 else set ss = ss2.
4. Return
    1. sharedSecret = ss

For security, the implementation MUST NOT explicitly return
or otherwise leak via a side-channel, decapsulation succeeded,
viz `cipherText == cipherText2`.

# Security Considerations

Kyber512, Kyber768 and Kyber1024 are designed to be post-quantum
IND-CCA2 secure KEMs, at the security levels of AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256.

The designers of Kyber recommend Kyber768.

The inner public key encryption SHOULD NOT be used directly,
as its ciphertexts are malleable.  Instead, for public key encryption,
HPKE can be used to turn Kyber into IND-CCA2 secure PKE {{RFC9180}} {{XYBERHPKE}}.

Any implementation MUST use implicit rejection as specified in {{S-decaps}}.
